# Vision

The most easy to use and snappy app to keep track of bird observations and checklists in smaller microbirding areas you are interested in.

# Motivation

My motivation was to:
* Develop a good web app for SthlmBetong, an informal group of birders in Stockholm, Sweden who want to keep track of observations and checklists in central Stockholm.
* Develop features for showing observations and checklists, that I had been thinking about over many years.
* Have the app as a platform for developing other features and services related to birding and birding trips that I have been thinking of over the years.
* Try out some new technologies like HTMX, modern geo-mapping libraries, databases like DuckDB, GitHub actions and Docker runtime setups with tools like Portainer and Traefik.

# Goals

The goals right now are:
* Color and style high-lighting of unusual observations.
* Show basic info and statistics on all observations ever made in an area.
* Users can register accounts.
* Show user and area lists.
* Support for more areas than just the SthlmBeting area.

# Guiding principles

User and business aspects:
* Free and open-source. But easy to make donations and possibly pay-for-services in the future for value-adding services
* User have 100% control over their data.
* Easy to use, easy to register account, easy to end account.
* Minimal user tracking and GDPR compliance.
 
Tech and design principles:
* KISS.
* Experiment with new technology, but KISS.
* I am the benevolent dictator of all technical and design decisions. :-)

# Roadmap

Now (January - March 2026):
* Color and style high-lighting of unusual observations.
* Show basic info and statistics on all observations ever made in an area.
* Fix some of the [issues](https://github.com/pacoispaco/microbirding/issues).

Next (April - June 2026):
* Users can register accounts.
* Show user and area lists.
* Support for 1 or 2 new areas.

Later (6+ months)
* TBD

# Backlog and ideas

Known issues:
* [Issues](https://github.com/pacoispaco/microbirding/issues).

Ideas:
* Add support for more detailed statistics and graphs. For example based on the phenology and/or activity of the observed birds.
